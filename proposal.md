# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PartyClash

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Discord party video game activity. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The party video game will be made through discord's developer, be for 4-6 people, and consist of three mini games: button smashing race, red light green light, obstacle course. For the button smashing, players will have to spam their space bar to get to the finish line. The red light green light game is pretty self explanatory. For the obstacle course, players will be in one positon while the surroundings move towards them. They can jump, crouch, and dash through obstacles. As time progresses, the obstacles will be moving faster and faster. At the end of each game, the player who wins gets a point. At the very end, whomever has the most points wins. 

This will be a 2-D game with hand drawn visuals and friends making the audio. I primarily want to do this for my small discord server with friends since we use the available Discord activities all the time. 

There needs to be a lobby where we wait for all players, a scoreboard screen shown between each mini game, and a winner screen showing who the most games. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I am aming to complete all three mini games, but being able to code the lobby and at least one functioning mini game will be good to me as a first time coder. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome is that the lobby, one to two games, and a scoreboard screen are working and in the right sequence by the deadlone. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is that the lobby, all three games with scoreboard screens, and a winner's screen work hopefully by the deadline. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn about Discord's developer to begin. Then, I would need to learn what actually goes into video games and start coding from there. This seems like a "learn as I go" project and any resources seem to be available through class and Discord. I will also need to learn how to implement visuals and audio. After I learn that, then I will draw the visuals and get my friends who I want to play these games with to do some funny voice sound effects. 

When it comes to the coding aspect, I think I would like to code the stationary screens first like the lobby, scoreboard, and winner screen before doing the mini games. I will work on the video games in the order I have them listed above. I especially want to leave the obstacle course game last because I think that would be harder.
