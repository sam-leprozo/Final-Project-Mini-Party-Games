Besides the set back I mentioned in the video, I did struggle with coding overall as I decided to learn C Script since Unity will be removing it's Python integration early next year. I did this because I had a lot of fun coming up with the concept and visuals for the game and knew that I would want to complete this on my own time. With the foundations of what we learned, learning C Script was not too bad, but remembering to use the different syntax caused me to debug for a while. I also struggled to find good tutorials and explanations from just one YouTuber. Since there are multiple ways to script something like movement, not every video used the same concepts and would cause conflicts between assets and code. For example, one tutorial I initially used early on had the second part behind a paywall and any other videos or tutorials I found would waste my prior efforts. 

I also struggled with trying to understand all the features of Unity. It is a really cool application, but trying to make PreFabs was difficult. I spent a lot more time Googling and learning the application than coding. 

This was a fun project, though. I appreciate the creative freedom we had for this.
