# Final-Project-Mini-Party-Games

December 7, 2024 - The biggest setback and struggle yet. My pc blue screened at 3 A.M. the "night" before. I basically lost everything besides the artwork I preuploaded to git. I am extremely frustrated and beyond sad, but we'll see how far I can get the game. I still have my video tutorials, but it's going to take a bit to recode the main menu and the first game again.
