Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have all the visuals like my drawings of characters and backgrounds for my Discord activity. I also have the majority of the sound effects that I recorded with friends over break ready. So far I can move past the beginning/lobby waiting room. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not gotten either of the three mini games done yet. I have started the first one, but this is turning out to be a bit more than I can chew. I still ideally want to be able to get one game and a scoreboard working by the deadline. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have mainly run into sintax errors from typos. Luckily the coding part isn't too crazy with the help of the resources from Discord. It is just very time consuming.
