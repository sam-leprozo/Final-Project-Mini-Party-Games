## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Party games
    similar to JackBox to use in Discord or in person
    with draw meme visuals 
    friends voice lines
    3 games: button smash race, hurdles race, redlight/greenlight race

Discord bot that's judgemental towards my friends by sending reaction memes to the questionable things they usually say
    ex: friend types something about about Valorant and bot sends a side-eye
