# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to make a video game similar to JackBox that my friends and I can use on Discord or in person. I would like to make it my own by drawing the visuals of well known memes and having my friends do some voice lines. I'll probably do only three mini games: button smashing race, a jumping over hurdles type of thing where it progressively gets faster, and a redlight/greenlight. I'm not really sure if that's realistic considering the time restraint. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is three mini games realistic for someone new to code? Do you have any suggestions of alternative games because I feel like the ones I thought about are all the same in a way?
